    <p>
      According to the 16 personality test, I am a Campaigner. I agree with this description of being (slightly) extraverted, intuitive, alot of feelings and prospecting. I embrace ideas and hope for a better world for us to live in.

      I am not too stuck in a dreaming state, which my Big 5 personality suggests. I do think I am practical as well. Which is reflected on my thinking analysis.
      I am more of an empathetic idealist mixed with analytical thinker.

      <ul>I use insight and creativity to help others, connecting seemingly unrelated ideas. Creating something new but sometimes too abstract, which would have a negative affect on others. Maybe confusing and/or misleading discussions, or brainstorming exercises. I would have to find a team that has a similar capability for abstract thought. Or I will have to restrain the extent of my big ideas, and bring in more feasible goals. In a group, I will have to find a balance of expressing my idealist ideas and communicating them, with being practical.</ul>

      <ul>I tend to be impulsive and easily sidetracked. I agree with the impulsiveness, which goes hand in hand with getting “sidetracked”, but to the extent of that I like new ideas and want to explore a lot of them.
        I do keep in mind of what will be good for me/ the group in the future, so what we do in the present should be planned and built towards a goal. I will have to be mindful of how many ideas I pursue and/or encourage in a group, quickly agreeing on one path and following it.
      </ul>

      <ul>
      I am extraverted and Agreeable. I do put people's needs above my own more often than not, which I think translates really well in a group environment. Listening and pursuing others' thoughts are statistically relevant, but I do like to hold strong on the ideas that are important, when it comes down to a debate. I engage a lot with people, seeking their approval and the emotional payoff. I think this is a detriment to my personality, because I think I need to do what is objectively right and not based on emotions that are sporadic. With these attributes, I believe I could fit into any group with initializing communications, attentive listening and being supportive.
      </ul>
