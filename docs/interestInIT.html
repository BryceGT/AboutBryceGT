  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why I like Information Technology</h2>

    Meeting people and making friends, several people working in or students of IT influenced me greatly to pursue a career in the brilliant, endless, terrifying and magical IT industry.

      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      margin: 50px;
      font-size: 20px;">I have always had an interest in IT, due to being raised in it! Having a clear mind on my surroundings in society, I had to appreciate the things I could do due to technology.
    Using social media to connect with my friends, experiencing unforgettable experiences in gaming, enhancing my productivity with the internet and phone applications.

      justify-content: center;

      margin: 50px;
      font-size: 20px;">The one friend who pushed me into the degree was someone I worked with and he finished this exact course last year. He told me about the fun problem solving algorithms, application development, creative web design and most importantly the job prospect!
    This was all within the RMIT course of Information Technology, which my friend said was challenging and rewarding. I followed his advice, and having been a student at RMIT before, I naturally enrolled with RMIT once more.
