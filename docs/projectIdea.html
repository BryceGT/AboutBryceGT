<h3 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h3>

  <p style="display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 50px;
    font-size: 20px;">
    This will be an open source website designed to rate and make companies accountable for their decisions. Either it be a wage gap, lack of maternity leave or unreported incidents. This will be a platform for people to know more about these companies, know what they are getting into, to know if they will be treated fairly.

    This website will help workers search and compare companies in multiple categories.

    Contributors will submit their experiences and share information. Focusing on rating and comparing companies, this website will draw back the curtain and force companies to change their ways. If no one wants to work with you because of your prejudices, then you must change.

    This project will be heavily reliant on user contributions. Which will require marketing and reaching out to already established employment companies for their resources. It will be a slow process after the initial development, but I believe that the idea of truth and fairness in the workplace will prevail. The project will have to be guarded until there is a reasonable amount of user input to make an accurate representation
    of a company. Exposure and reliance on users will be the greatest obstacle.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Motivation</h3>

  <p style="display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 50px;
    font-size: 20px;">
The Australian gender pay gap is currently at 14%, as per the May report from the Australian Gender Equality Agency. It is lower than the past, but does it still need to exist? The need for people to know if they are being fairly treated is essential. Information is accessible but is hard to find. Many potential employees will wonder but never know for certain the comparison of wages at a particular company. If there was a way to know, which was easily accessible, I believe it would funnel workers into more progressive and ethical businesses. Giving more power to the worker, more trust in their potential employer and the right to contribute to change.

  </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Description</h3>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
Submitting information as a contributor in the fields of; Wage, position, experience, qualifications, gender and age. Users can create a profile that will be subjected to filtering and dispersed into the overall sites comparison avenues. This will contribute to the sites ability to achieve any users' inquiries, as in if someone only wants to know what experience a particular company looks for, they can quickly search through that category.
</ul>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
Rating of the Company. Displaying average in pay gap in positions and overall. This will be the most focused feature, due to the site's main goal is to survey companies' gender equality. The wage gap average will have the largest graph on the pages.
</ul>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
  Rating the Company's support. The user can fill out the form if they choose to. There will be a category for each company in these several fields:
  Medical. What healthcare do they offer? Saving plans for prescriptions, optometrist or daycare etc
  Life. Does the company have life insurance? Accidental death/dismemberment insurance? Funeral costs/ ongoing living expenses?
  Disability. Short or long term disability insurance?
  Retirement. What super do they support/suggest? Does the company have their own retirement fund?

</ul>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
Unions can submit their own contributions to the site, with the incentive of free marketing for themselves. The companies will have a section displaying these submissions. Which union do they associate themselves with? What type of relation do they have with unions? What is the union's view on the company?
</ul>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
Having a platform for reporting incidents. The contributor will have to submit a background check. Submitting proof of employment which enters reviewing. A contributors review of a company will be flagged with a symbol that indicates that they have submitted a report. It will be internally processed and submitted into appropriate channels. Consultation will be sent to users on due processes to continue their report. This may require legal assistance, which will be limited until financial funds can support .
</ul>

<ul style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
  Regular updates on the website to keep it relevant and secure.
  Checking KPIs, what makes this website appealing and adding to it. Reading search engine ratings and applying reviewed responses.
  There will be annual (or more regular) upgrades in user experience. Updating with changing layouts, functions, accessibility and general usability.
  Backing up the server regularly, through the hosting company. Securing information is stored and can be accessed in the future.
  Relevant copyright checks, privacy policies, disclaimers in the terms and conditions of the site.
  Having independent fact checking and investigations into users submissions. Spamming posts or flooding companies with negative reviews will be banned, and the affected company will be rectified.


</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tools and Technologies</h3>

<p style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
  Will require a server. Setting one up on a powerful computer or a dedicated one.
  There are hosting companies that provide deals on hour usage or storage space. They are relatively inexpensive and relinquish maintenance tasks for me to improve efficiencies in other areas of the site.

  A computer for maintenance, development and reviewing submissions. Initially i will only need my own computer, but when the site grows and requires more regular updates and contact responses, each employee will need their own set up.
  A phone line, to receive private calls and for accessibility for non-computer users. Along with every website dedicated phone, the team member will need a computer to submit information on behalf of the user.


</p>


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Skills Required</h3>

<p style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">

  In website development, I will need to learn more extensive CSS, HTML and javascript. Creating an appealing website is crucial.
  I already understand the fundamentals of HTML, it is the least complicated of the three languages that are involved in website development.
  I will continue to learn creative user experiences with css on the scrimba site. I can also take up web development courses within my Bachelor of Information Technology.
  Increasing interactivity with JavaScript, by learning from learning sites or text book (+$100)


  Marketing. I need to draw in users, through several avenues. Google search engine optimisation, advertising and social media.
  I can gather support from a friend who has worked for a firm that specialises in optimizing google searches. I have experience in running social media accounts for individuals and small businessâ€™.
  Server creation or management.
  This may be the simplest, with multiple sources for purchasing server space.
  Having a hosting company will help with backing up storage and small bug fixes.

</p>




<h3 style="text-align: center;">Outcome</h3>
<p style="display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px;
  font-size: 20px;">
  This website will contribute greatly to the reduction of wage gaps in Australia. Workers will hopefully use this website along with LinkedIn and job posting sites. This website will encourage work places to evaluate their contracts, working conditions and resource management. A worker will start an application process and know what to expect, leading to more transparency. In success, impacting the improvement of life for all workers.
