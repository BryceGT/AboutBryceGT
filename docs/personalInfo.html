<h2>A little about myself...</h2>

<p>
  Hello! I am Bryce Glenn Thomson and this is some information about myself.  Having both parents being from Britain, I am both British and Australian citizen.
  I was born and raised in regional Victoria, being the class clown in primary to being a quiet teenager in highschool.
  I always read books, obsessed with fantasy and classic literature, with titles like Legend of Drizzt, The Magician, Mortal Instruments, Perfume, Frankenstein and Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Along with reading, I loved games. Always having a console, playing out my childhood drifting on Underground 2 and fighting the Locust on Gears of War. There are too many games that I like, I couldnâ€™t name them all!</p>

<p>After moving to Melbourne, when I became a legal adult, I started studying Creative Writing at Swinburne, then into Culinary school and Interactive Media after that. I changed around alot, never finding an interesting field of study.</p>

<p>Throughout these trials and errors, I was always coding, either on Unity (C#) or making silly word games with Python.
I usually spent my days (very sad lockdown situation) climbing on bouldering walls, swimming, long distance running, working, reading, socialising and gaming. Now I am a full time student and loving it!
</p>
